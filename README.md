## Instructions

For this section you will demonstrate your knowledge of React by completing a
simple calculator application.

The framework for this app has been provided for you as well. You will *_not_*
need to contribute any custom css or styling.

- You may choose to build out EITHER the class component framework `Class.js`
  or functional component framework utilizing hooks `Hook.js`
- Comment in ONLY the `import` statement at the top of the page that
  corresponds to your chosen approach inside of `App.js`. Leaving both commented out or commented
  in simultaneously will result in a failed test.


- All code should be written in `./src/components/Class.js` or `./src/components/Hook.js` depending on whether you're using hooks or class syntax.
- When not displaying a number `input` and `display` values should be an empty
  string `''`
- `+` should be the default operator.
- If `Calculate` is attempted without 2 number inputs, `Select Two Numbers`
  should be rendered as an error message.
